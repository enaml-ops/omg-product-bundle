# example to demonstrate how we would load up the vault with data

#set where your vault lives
VAULT_ADDR=http://192.168.0.1:8200

#set which hash your writing to
VAULT_HASH=secret/pcf-np-1-password

go get github.com/enaml-ops/omg-cli/plugins/products/cloudfoundry/cmd/passgen
passgen > vault-passwords.json

./vault write ${VAULT_HASH} @vault-passwords.json
./vault read ${VAULT_HASH}
