# example to demonstrate how we would load up the vault with data

#set where your vault lives
VAULT_ADDR=http://192.168.0.1:8200

#set which hash your writing to
VAULT_HASH=secret/pcf-np-1-hostname

./vault write ${VAULT_HASH} @vault-host.json
./vault read ${VAULT_HASH}

# or
# mix files and cli
# ./vault write ${VAULT_HASH} apps-domain=.apps.cfapps.io @vault-host.json
# ./vault read ${VAULT_HASH}

# or
# just cli
# ./vault write ${VAULT_HASH} apps-domain=.apps.cfapps.io /
# sys-domain=.system.cfapps.io
# ./vault read ${VAULT_HASH}
